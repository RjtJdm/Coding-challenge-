Coding challenge
A new start!!! 365Â days
Hello folks,
First of all HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021!.Â 
I am Rajat Jadam. At the time of writing this I am a salesforce developer at Metacube software Pvt. Ltd.
First question that you guys may be thinking, why I am here. And what is this challenge all about?
Â A 365 days challenge!!
This challenges aims to those who want to achieve more, For those who think they deserve more.
Before telling much about the challenge, Let me tell you about myself.Â 
I am a programmer. I love my job, as it excides me a lot. But the thing that bothers me is My coding skills. I am a good coder(as I suppose), but I lack somewhere in competitive coding. So as a new year resolution, I want to try this challenge.
So here is a my 365 day challenge(Which we can increase too!) which contains lot of questions as well as my understanding about the solution.
I wanted to create a YouTube channel for that, but believe me I am not that too experienced too handle that heat!!
I don't know when it will end, but Believe me it will make our carrier.
Best way to start with the Coding is ' Hello world program '.Â 
Lets make itÂ .
#include<iostream>
int main(){
Â cout<<"Hello 2021!";
}
For this solely purpose, I have created this github directory, Feel free to contribute to this initiative. I would love to work as a community!
